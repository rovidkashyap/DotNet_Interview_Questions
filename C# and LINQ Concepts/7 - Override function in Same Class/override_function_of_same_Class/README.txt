In C#, you cannot override a method within the same class. Method overriding is meant for scenarios 
involving inheritance, where a derived class provides a new implementation for a method defined in a 
base class.

However, you can overload methods within the same class, which means defining multiple methods with the 
same name but different parameter lists.

In this program, you will see that `Derived Class` overrides the `MyMethod` from `BaseClass`.
