            // Here we are only show you that how many ways through which we can achieved Abstraction

            // Basically Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object.
            // Abstraction can be achieved using Abstract Classes
            // Abstraction can be achieved using Interfaces

            // NOW Questions Arises WHen to Use Abstract Classes and Interfaces
            
            // ABSTRACT CLASSES - When you have common base class that provides some default behavior and enforces certain methods to be implemented by derived classes.
            // Abstract classes are useful when you want to share code among several closely related classes.
            
            // INTERFACES - When you need to define a contract that can be implemented by any class, regardless of its position in the class hierarchy. Interfaces are
            // useful for providing a common interface across different classes and supporting multiple inheritance.

            // By Using Abstraction, you can create more modular, maintainable and understandable code.
